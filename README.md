## Important Notice

This is a fork from the "pre-release" software for beta testers of Roastmaster for iOS10, originally developed by Rainfrog Inc. This version has been adapted to run on a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** (or similar SBC) using **Python 3**.

## Roastmaster RDP Probe Host (Python/Raspberry Pi)

`Roastmaster_RDP_Probe_Host` is a customizable Single Board Computer (SBC) application to send sensor readings via the Roastmaster Datagram Protocol (RDP) to Roastmaster iOS over a WiFi Network.

Roastmaster is coffee roasting toolkit and data logging software, in which users can log temperature data during their coffee roasting sessions. This logging can be done either manually or via separate electronic thermocouple reading "clients".

The RDP Protocol is an OpenSource communications protocol created by Rainfrog, Inc. for the purpose of standardizing the transmission of roasting information to Roastmaster.

This implementation supports multiple sensor types simultaneously, specifically handling the **MCP9600** (Thermocouple Amplifier) via Hardware I2C and the **SCD-41** (CO2, Temp, Humidity) via Software I2C.

## Software Features

* **Python 3 Implementation:** Runs on standard Linux distributions (Raspberry Pi OS).
* **Multi-Sensor Support:** Currently configured for MCP9600 (Thermocouple) and SCD-41 (CO2/Environmental).
* **Web Monitor:** Includes a local JSON logger to visualize packets via a local Apache web server.
* **Handles Handshaking:** Manages SYN/ACK handshaking with Roastmaster.
* **Unlimited Sensors:** Hosts multiple sensors, each sending on a unique channel (RDP supports 16).
* **Packet Ordering:** Supports RDP "Epoch" values to ensure correct packet ordering over UDP.

## RDP Protocol Features

* Operates over the easy-to-use User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
* Lightweight, consuming very little network bandwidth.
* Server is multicast discoverable (224.0.0.1).
* Supports basic handshaking (SYN/ACK), simulating a "connection".
* Data format is compact, human-readable JSON.

## Hardware Requirements

* **SBC:** Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (or similar Raspberry Pi model).
* **Primary Sensor:** Adafruit MCP9600 I2C Thermocouple Amplifier (K-Type).
* **Secondary Sensor:** Adafruit SCD-41 (CO2, Temperature, Humidity).
* **Wiring:**
    * **MCP9600:** Connected to Hardware I2C (SDA: GPIO 2, SCL: GPIO 3).
    * **SCD-41:** Connected to Software I2C (Configured for SDA: GPIO 23, SCL: GPIO 24).

## Configuration & Setup

### 1. System Dependencies
Ensure your Raspberry Pi is up to date and has I2C enabled (`sudo raspi-config` -> Interface Options -> I2C).

Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip apache2
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-mcp9600
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-scd4x
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-bitbangio
sudo pip3 install adafruit-blinka
```

### 2. Network Configuration

The Raspberry Pi handles WiFi connections via the OS (wpa_supplicant). Ensure your Pi is connected to the same WiFi network as your iOS device running Roastmaster.

### 3. Application Configuration

Edit the roastmaster_host.py file to match your Roastmaster settings:

Host Serial: Set HOST_SERIAL to match the "Serial" string defined in your Roastmaster probe definition.

Port: Set SERVER_PORT (Default: 5050).

Sensor Pins: Verify SCD_SDA_PIN and SCD_SCL_PIN match your wiring for the secondary sensor.

### 4. Web Monitor (Optional)

This host logs packets to /var/www/html/rdp_packet.json. To view the live data stream:

Ensure Apache is installed (sudo apt-get install apache2).

Grant write permissions to the web folder: sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html.

Place monitor.html in /var/www/html/.

Navigate to http://<your-pi-ip>/monitor.html in a browser.

## RDP Channel Mapping

This implementation maps the sensors to the following RDP Channels. You must configure Roastmaster "Curves" to listen to these specific channels:

Channel 1: Bean Temp (MCP9600 Thermocouple) - RPMetaType: 3000 (BT Temp) 

Channel 2: Exhaust Temp (SCD-41 Temp) - RPMetaType: 3004 (Exhaust Temp) 

Channel 3: Humidity (SCD-41 RH%) - RPMetaType: 3005 (Ambient Temp) 

Channel 4: CO2 (SCD-41 PPM) - RPMetaType: 3002 (MET Temp) 

Note: Humidity and CO2 are sent as "Temperature" events (RPEventType: 3) so that Roastmaster can graph them as curves.
